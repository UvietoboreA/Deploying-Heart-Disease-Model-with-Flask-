# ðŸ«€ Deploying Heart Disease Model - Flask Web App 

## ðŸš€ Overview  
This project is a **machine learning-powered web application** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. It is built using **Flask**, a lightweight web framework for Python, and leverages a **Random Forest** model for predictions. The dataset used for training contains various health-related parameters that influence heart disease risk.

| `chol` | Serum cholesterol (mg/dl) |
| `fbs` | Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl, 1 = True, 0 = False) |
| `restecg` | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| `thalach` | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| `exang` | Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No) |
| `oldpeak` | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
| `slope` | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| `ca` | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy |
| `thal` | Thalassemia type (0-3) |
| **Target (`output`)** | 1 = Heart Disease Present, 0 = No Heart Disease |
